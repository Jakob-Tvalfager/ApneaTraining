# ApneaTraining

A C program to improve CO2 tolerance for sleep apnea using breath-hold exercises adapted from freediving CO2 tables.

# Why train CO2 tolerance to beat sleep apnea?

**Note:** Audio files (`audio/complete.oga`, etc.) may not work in browser environments, but all core breathing training functionality will work perfectly.

### Quick Start Instructions for Cloud Environments:
1. Click any button above
2. Wait for the environment to load
3. In the terminal, run: `./apneaTraining`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts

If the program isn't compiled yet, run:
```bash
gcc -o apneaTraining apneaTraining.c
./apneaTraining


## Overview

This project provides a command-line tool to train CO2 tolerance, helping users breathe more steadily to reduce sleep apnea symptoms. It includes three training modes:

### Training Modes
Type A - Fixed Breath Hold, Decreasing Rest. Short session.

Type B - Increasing Breath Hold, Fixed Rest. Short session.

Type C - Fixed Breath Hold, Fixed Rest, Infinite Loop. Also known as tidal breathing. Can be as long as you want it.

The program measures a "Relaxed Pause" (breath-hold time after exhale) and saves it to `relaxedPauseData.txt` for progress tracking

## Usage

### Running Binaries
Precompiled binaries are provided in the `bin` folder:
- Linux: `apnea_linux`

Download the appropriate binary and run:
- Linux:
  ```bash
  chmod +x bin/apnea_linux
  ./bin/apnea_linux
  ```

### Compilation Instructions

#### Linux
1. Install GCC:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gcc
   ```
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   .../ApneaTraining$ gcc -Wall -std=c11 apneaTraining.c -o ./bin/apnea_linux
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./bin/apnea_linux
   ```

## Requirements

- **Linux**: GCC, Ubuntu linux has been tested. (Needed for `unistd.h`, `sleep`)

## Notes

- The program creates and reads from `relaxedPauseData.txt` in the working directory. [todo: use ini file instead]
